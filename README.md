# Saphatax
Mindustry V6 mod that includes various types of new buildings, units, and other things. Some ideas are by friends, some by me.

Warning: also includes some crazy powerful sandbox-only stuff, such as Wrath of Everything.

# Other Info
The phaser turret is actually a remake from an old, abandoned mod of mine.

I can't learn alpha bleeding so you are stuck with the ugly super-thin outlines nobody wants. Unless you disable linear filtering.
