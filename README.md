# Saphatax
Mindustry V6 mod that includes various types of new buildings, units, and other things. Some ideas are by friends, some by me.

warning: also includes some crazy powerful sandbox-only stuff, such as Wrath of Everything

# Other Info
The phaser turret is actually a remake from an old, abandoned mod of mine.

I somehow cannot get motion generator to be able to be built.

**oh god please help i cant learn alpha bleeding**
